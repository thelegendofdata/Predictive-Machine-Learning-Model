# Predictive-Machine-Learning-Model


**Project description**
The data is stored in three files:

* gold_recovery_train.csv — training dataset download
* gold_recovery_test.csv — test dataset download
* gold_recovery_full.csv — source dataset download
Data is indexed with the date and time of acquisition (date feature). Parameters that are next to each other in terms of time are often similar.

Some parameters are not available because they were measured and/or calculated much later. That's why, some of the features that are present in the training set may be absent from the test set. The test set also doesn't contain targets.

The source dataset contains the training and test sets with all the features.

You have the raw data that was only downloaded from the warehouse. Before building the model, check the correctness of the data. For that, use our instructions.
